Hi,

I am currently a master student at Utrecht University in the [Game and Media Technology](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/game-and-media-technology) programme.
I have done my bachelor at Leiden University the study [Informatics](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelor/informatica).

Master thesis:
Map Fusion algorithm to merge two graphs.
* [map fusion](https://github.com/jvtubergen/map-fusion) glues together the data pipeline, map fusion algorithm, and experiments.
* [gmaps-image](https://github.com/jvtubergen/gmaps-image) retrieve satellite image data of arbitrary size with the Google Maps API.

From my bachelor thesis I researched the capabilities of sound interactive related activities in the context of mobile applications.
* [audiosync](https://github.com/jvtubergen/audiosync) web-application capable to synchronize audio output on multiple devices.
* [audiosignal-correlation](https://github.com/jvtubergen/audiosignal-correlation) WebGL code with SIMD optimization to cross-correlate audio in its raw format (no FFT applied).
