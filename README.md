# About Me

I'm a master's student at Utrecht University pursuing [Game and Media Technology](https://www.uu.nl/en/masters/game-and-media-technology), with a bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/bachelor/informatica) from Leiden University.

## Master's Research: Graph Map Fusion

My master's thesis focuses on developing a late-fusion multi-modal map reconstruction algorithm to intelligently merge road network graphs reconstructed from satellite imagery and GPS data.

### Key Projects:
- **[map-fusion](https://github.com/jvtubergen/map-fusion)** - Complete pipeline integrating data processing, map fusion algorithms, and experimental validation
- **[gmaps-image](https://github.com/jvtubergen/gmaps-image)** - Google Maps API tool for retrieving satellite images of arbitrary dimensions
- **[sat2graph-simplified](https://github.com/jvtubergen/Sat2Graph-simplified)** - Enhanced version of [Sat2Graph](https://github.com/songtaohe/Sat2Graph) for road network extraction from satellite imagery
- **[partial-curve-matching-rs](https://github.com/jvtubergen/partial-curve-matching-rs)** - Rust implementation for computing partial curve matching between curves and graphs

## Bachelor's Research: Audio Synchronization

My bachelor's thesis explored sound-based interactive capabilities for mobile applications, leading to practical synchronization solutions.

### Key Projects:
- **[audiosignal-correlation](https://github.com/jvtubergen/audiosignal-correlation)** - SIMD-optimized WebGL implementation for real-time audio cross-correlation without FFT preprocessing
- **[audiosync](https://github.com/jvtubergen/audiosync)** - Web application enabling precise audio output synchronization across multiple mobile devices
  - Presented the audio processing pipeline and a demonstration of an enhanced version at [Web Audio Conference (WAC) 2022](https://wac2022.i3s.univ-cotedazur.fr/)

## Other (Small) Projects

- **[reverse-http-proxy](https://github.com/jvtubergen/reverse-http-proxy)** - A minimal reverse proxy for path-based HTTP routing
- **[https-wrapper](https://github.com/jvtubergen/https-wrapper)** - Minimalistic HTTPS reverse proxy that adds TLS encryption to any HTTP server
- **[http-to-https-redirect](https://github.com/jvtubergen/http-to-https-redirect)** - Lightweight Rust server that redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS
- **[simple-audio-player](https://github.com/jvtubergen/simple-audio-player)** - Minimal audio player to play sound files from the terminal
